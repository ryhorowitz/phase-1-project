# Hebrew Birthday Calculator

## About

The Hebrew Birthday Calculator is a single page app that allows someone to findout what their Hebrew birthday is. The Hebrew calandar is lunar and varies from year to year compared to the Gregorian. For instance the Hebrew date of Kislev 13 can appear anywhere beteween November 17th - December 14th on the Gregorian calendar. The calculator allows you to find out your Hebrew birthday and accounts for time of birth, before or after sundown.

The app also gives todays date in both the Gregorian and Hewbrew calandar while also telling you when the next Hebrew month (new moon / *Rosh Chodesh*) will start.
